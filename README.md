## Note on Repository Access

This repository should stay private. If you make it public, you are possibly providing your solution to other students taking the class. Generally the projects in this class are not great portfolio projects because they are too small, or for the later projects, contain a significant portion of code that is not your own and therefore does not demonstrate your skill. Please keep your repository private so other students can't use your solution.
